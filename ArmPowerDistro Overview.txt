Arm Power Distro Overview:

total of 3 arm PDBs (2 on upper arm, one on lower arm)
TODO: find out microcontroller - STM32 (exact model?)

Key functions:
	relays
	read voltage & current on all lines (24V & 5V Rails) - find out sensor? protocol?
	CAN bus

Code Overview:
	Initialisation:
		open relays
		init protocols (CAN, voltage/current sense)
		
	In Loop:
		read voltage/current - sensor - INA226 over i2c
		CAN incoming for relay shutoff (?) - refer to can spec
		CAN outgoing voltage & current info - refer to can spec
		
Outline:

	To Include:
		i2c lib
		can lib
		manufacturer libraries
		
	Init:
		Board Pins/Registers
		Init_CAN
		Init_i2c
	
	While(1):
		Can msg check (arm shut off, etc.)
		i2c read for voltage & current
		assemble CAN packet to be sent
		send CAN packet with voltage & current to BBB
